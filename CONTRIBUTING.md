# Contributing to colorrs

This is a pretty chill project. It's just me, and it's not mission critical for anyone, so don't expect a high standard of maintanence. 

Basically, the rules be:

## NO SUDO
This tool does not require administrator privileges. It will not and should never require that. If what you're trying to do requires that, 
think of another way to do it or go away. I don't want to brick some poor person's fragile Arch install with my janky hobby project.

## New patterns go in the `.toml` format.
If you want to contribute a pattern to the repository, put it in the `.toml` format. It isn't hard to do, and this repo isn't going to accept 
any platform-specific scripts.

In addition, if you didn't create the art for the pattern, give credit to the original creator if possible.

## Have fun
Anyone caught not having fun will be shot with a gun. See the way I'm lyrical? Not many maintainers can do that.
